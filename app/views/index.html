      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What's the problem the service is trying to solve?</h2>

      <p>In recent years geese have become increasingly popular and this alternative Christmas bird has proven
        itself a versatile commodity to own. Whether its the poultry farming market, the lucrative feather market (producing high-street feather jackets,
        luxury down duvets, ethnic jewellery and more) or the newly established 'experience' market (hipsters spending their money on goose walking days out)
        it seems that geese are trending everywhere. Due to this increase in demand, we are seeing a rise of small scale goose farms that are not being monitored
        for either the welfare standards of the geese or for their taxable income. Even more incidious is the emergance of a goose black market where the rarer geese
        breeds are being trafficked illegally. By making sure large numbers of geese along with smaller numbers of geese that provide an income are registerd the
        government hopes to get on top of these new problems.

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What do we already know about?</h2>

      <p>Farmers with large flocks of birds for commercial purposes are already registered under agriculture laws/services run by Defra. We are concerned about large flocks
        that are not under the defra registration schemes and/or smaller flocks that generate an income :
